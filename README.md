Hi!
This is my frist time using git-hub!
My name is Azim and I am a freshman at the University of South Florida. I decided to start learning python to prepare myself for all the fun programming classes that i am going to attend at thad university. I am going to be creating multiple projects, and i will make sure to upload some of them to this place.
