Time and weather application
----------------------------------------------
A python application that location, local time and weather information of the user
----------------------------------------------
What skills I have used:
1. Creation of GUI (by using tkinter)
2. Using IP address to track location of the user (Geocode module)
3. Showing local time of the user (datetime module)
4. Using weather API to display weather situation (pyowm module)

P.S. - this my first file on git hub.
